# Fly Wars

Project Summary/Description <br/>

Game Concept and Look <br/>

Inspired from the game Space Impact, the player must kill all enemies. It is a one player game where he/she has a spaceship or his/her shooter and the player must use the spacebar to attack.<br/>

In the game screen you’ll see a galaxy. Your spaceship is at the lower center of the screen at default. An enemy will be spawned as soon as the game starts. The enemies will move vertically. You’ll know you hit an enemy when the it is gone from the screen. <br/>


Gameplay <br/>

The player has the ability to move freely vertically. The player will use the arrow keys to navigate vertically. The enemies are spawned randomly. The player would then try to hit or kill the enemies with his bullets. The player must press the spacebar to activate his bullets. <br/>

The enemies or flies spawn at random points at the upper half of the screen. When a fly hits the spaceship, the player will lose a life. The player will gain points if he or she successfully hit a fly. <br/> 

There is no win condition for the player, you just have to survive. When the player’s life reaches zero, the game is over. <br/>



Objective <br/>

	To keep the player’s life above zero. <br/>
